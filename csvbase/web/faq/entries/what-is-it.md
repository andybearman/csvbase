## A simple web database

csvbase is a public, open-access database.

Anyone can upload new tables to csvbase.

Each table is made available in various formats:
- CSV
- JSON
- Parquet
- Microsoft Excel
- and others

Each table also has it's own API.

And you can of course edit tables directly on the web.
