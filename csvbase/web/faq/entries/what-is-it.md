csvbase is a <ins>public</ins>, <ins>open access</ins> database.

The data on csvbase comes in table-form: with columns and rows.

It is called *csv*base because one of the easiest ways to interact with it is
via csv files.  To get the csv file for any table, just add `.csv` to the url, so

[https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges](https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges)

becomes

<a href="https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges.csv">https://csvbase.com/meripaterson/stock-exchanges<strong>.csv</strong></a>

Anyone can create an account and start creating tables on csvbase.

Each table on csvbase is made available in various formats:
- CSV
- JSON
- Parquet
- Microsoft Excel
- and [others](/faq/formats)

Each table also has it's own API.

You also can directly edit your tables via a web browser.
