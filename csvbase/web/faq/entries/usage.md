## How many tables can I create?

There is no limit on number of public tables a user can create.

Supporters can also create private tables.

## What are the size limits?

Tables must have fewer than 1,600 columns.

They can be unlimited size, but you can only upload 50 megabytes of data at
once - so larger tables will need to be built up iteratively via appending.

## How long are tables kept?

Tables are kept forever.
