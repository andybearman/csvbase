csvbase has a [very simple interface](table-url) and doesn't usually require explicit
support from a tool.

If there is a place to enter a url, just enter the table's url with the file
extension for the [format](formats) that tool will be expecting (eg `.csv`).

Many tools work out of the box this way.
