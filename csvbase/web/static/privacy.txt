## Personal information we collect

We currently collect the following personal information from users who choose
to register:

- a username
- a timezone, if you change from the default of UTC
- and, optionally, an email address

If you experience a crash (eg a 500 error) we collect extra information about
your configuration, strictly for the purposes of debugging that crash.  That is
shared with Sentry (https://sentry.io/) and they retain it for 30 days.

For subscription purposes, our payment provider Stripe collects your payment
data, including credit card details, name, and address. We do not have access
to this data; it's solely used to process your payments.

## How we get the personal information and why we have it

We collect personal information directly during registration.

We use the information that you have given us to give your account a unique
name.  The email address is used if you forget your password.

Sentry collects data about users who experience a crash.  And Stripe only
collect data you provide to them.

We do not share this information with any other other parties.

## Legal basis for processing

Our processing of your personal information is based on your consent, which you
can withdraw at any time by contacting us.
