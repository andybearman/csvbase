## The type of personal information we collect

We currently collect the following personal information from users who choose
to register:

If you experience a crash we collect extra, impersonal, information about your
configuration, strictly for the purposes of debugging that crash.  That is
shared with Sentry (https://sentry.io/) and retained for 30 days.  Personal
information is shared with Sentry.

## How we get the personal information and why we have it

We only collect personal information directly, when you register.

We use the information that you have given us to give your account a unique

(opt-in) email notifications.

We do not share this information with any other parties.

is:
